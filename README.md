# Nday_infra

Hello! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Peking University, currently preparing to enter the job market. In order to align my skills with industry requirements, I am restructuring my technical stack and deepening my foundational knowledge. My technology stack will include the following components:

1. **Programming Languages:** Python, C++
2. **Kernel Development:** CUDA, CUTLASS, FlashInfer
3. **Deep Learning Compiler:** TVM
4. **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
5. **Training Framework:** Megatron-LM
6. **Inference Framework:** vLLM-v1, llama.cpp, TensorRT-LLM

Additionally, I plan to share insights on essential topics such as various parallelism strategies.

I hope that this learning path encourages you to explore and embrace AI infrastructure. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue.
